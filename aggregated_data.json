We\ndid this to leverage the experience we have in\nthe RCP of working with student software\ninterns by collaborating with labs. \nBecause this is unpaid, we aim to get students  \nvia the official programs at the University of\nMelbourne so they can obtain course credit.\nThis program allows us to share our\nknowledge and experiences with the students\nto help them to build their confidence so thatthey know that they have the skills and\ninitiative to handle future situations.\nThere are three intakes during the year,\nSemester 1, Semester 2, and Summer.\nWe aim to share the information from our\ncurrent student interns to our future student\ninterns. We do this by getting our current\nstudents to document the nuances of the\nproject and the challenges that they faced. \nWe are constantly trying to improve the\nexperience for our students and always\nappreciate feedback.\nWhile our most consistent feedback is to have  \nan in-person work environment, we are only\nproviding 100% online work environments.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 3Students at RSE Parkville lunch that happens on the second Thursday of each month.Proactive\nProactiveProactive\nProactive\nConcept-first approach\nIt is important for students to\nunderstand the high-level concepts of\nthe domain the student is working in.\nThis increases the independence of\nthe student to work through complexity.\nTest your limits\nThe ability to learn quickly by doing\nyour own research is important.\nFinding out how fast you learn and\nwhere your limits are, in a safe space,\ncan help you to know yourself better.Philosophy\nDocumentation is Key\nStudents need to recognise the limited\ntime they have and what they can\nachieve. This is why documentation is\nkey to ensure information is passed to\nfuture students.\nCollaboration is vital\nThere are multiple internships running\nat the same time. We encourage\nstudents to collaborate within projects\nand across sister projects (similar\nprojects) via co-working meetings.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 4Benefits for Students\nThere are many benefits for student interns in\nthis program to help them progress in their\ncareers by giving them opportunities to grow\nand learn in a safe environment and achieve\ntheir potential, which builds confidence.\nMany students start the program having some\nlevel of technical skills, but very little\nunderstanding of how important it is to know\nthe nuances and concepts of the work\nenvironment and domain knowledge.\nThis is why we give them the time to research\nthe concepts and give them feedback on how\nto refine those concepts.\nStudent interns are provided with honest\nfeedback to show where their skills and\nabilities place them, what kind of organisation\nthey might be a good fit with, and how they\ncan improve during and after the internship.Students also get the opportunity to learn real-\nworld skills such as keeping meeting notes,\ndocumentation, learning how to communicate,\nand giving presentations. \nStudents also get the opportunity to deal with\nrealistic data and real world problems, where\nthe answers and the technical solution is not\nso clear as in their coursework.\nStudents are encouraged to self-direct during\nthe internship. Balancing what the student\nwants to do and benefiting WEHI is a great\nexample of a fantastic project.\nAll in all, students have the opportunity to\nleave the internship with an improved sense of\nconfidence that they have the ability to handle\nnew environments and domains, even if they\nhaven't worked in that area before. This is the\nbest outcome we can hope for as supervisors.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 5\nTop L-R: Youran Zhou, Marika Benetti-Hille.

This is a snippet of the\nfull Code of Conduct on the website.\nThis community is made up of a diverse\nmixture of researchers, research software\nengineers, professionals and students.\nDiversity is what we are hoping to improve our\ncommunities and workplaces, but it can also\nlead to communication issues and\nunhappiness. \nTo that end, we have a few ground rules that\nwe ask people to adhere to. This code applies\nequally to founders, mentors and those\nseeking help and guidance.\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of things that you\ncan\u2019t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which\nit\u2019s intended -a guide to make it easier to\nenrich all of us and the technical communities\nin which we participate.\nThis code of conduct applies to all spaces\nmanaged by the group. This includes chat\nrooms, the mailing lists, events, and any other\nforums created by the platform which the\ncommunity uses for communication. \nIn addition, violations of this code outside\nthese spaces may affect a person's ability to\nparticipate within them. If you believe\nsomeone is violating the code of conduct,\nplease let us know.\nThe key points are:\nBe friendly and patient.\nBe welcoming.\nBe considerate.\nBe respectful.\nBe careful with the words you choose.We strive to be a community that welcomes\nand supports people of all backgrounds and\nidentities. This includes, but is not limited to\nmembers of any race, ethnicity, culture,\nnational origin, colour, immigration status,\nsocial and economic class, educational level,\nsex, sexual orientation, gender identity and\nexpression, age, size, family status, political\nbelief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\nYour work will be used by other people, and\nyou in turn will depend on the work of others.\nAny decision you take will affect users and\ncolleagues, and you should take those\nconsequences into account when making\ndecisions. Remember that we\u2019re a diverse\ncommunity, so you might not be\ncommunicating in someone else\u2019s primary\nlanguage.\nNot all of us will agree all the time, but\ndisagreement is no excuse for poor behavior\nand poor manners. We might all experience\nsome frustration now and then, but we cannot\nallow that frustration to turn into a personal\nattack. It\u2019s important to remember that a\ncommunity where people feel uncomfortable\nor threatened is not a productive one.\nMembers of the community should be\nrespectful when dealing with other members\nas well as with people outside the community.\nWhen we disagree, try to understand why.\nDisagreements, both social and technical,\nhappen all the time and we are no exception. It\nis important that we resolve disagreements\nand differing views constructively. Remember\nthat we\u2019re different. The strength of this\ncommunity comes from its diversity. Different\npeople have different perspectives on issues.\nBeing unable to understand why someone\nholds a viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re\nwrong. \nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 7Want to know more?\nAll the information on this page is on the\nwebsite\u2019s main student page via the QR code\ndown below.\nFAQ\nThere is a FAQ on the website under \u201cKey\nDocuments to review and FAQ\u201d.\nThis FAQ provides information on:\nApplying for the internship program,\nOnboarding onto the program,\nWhat is expected at meetings, and\nWhat is expected when you finish.\nKey Milestones and Emails\nThe Key Milestones and Emails page can be\nfound under \u201cKey Documents to review and\nFAQ\u201d.\nAt the bottom fo the Key Milestones and\nEmails page you can find the onboarding\nemails that are sent out throughout the intake\nto remind students of the expectations of the\nprogram.\nLearn real world skills\nWe prepare students for the real-world by\nteaching them:\nhow understanding the domain problem\nand the users is more important than\ntechnical skills, and how to work on a\ncomplex, ambiguous project,\nshowing them how to become as\nindependent as possible,\nshow them how to document and share\nknowledge to others in a professional\nmanner,\nexplain how a software maturity model can\nhelp clarify expectations, and\nteaching them how to work productively in\na remote environment.We even tell students how to try to avoid the\ntop 5 mistakes that students make.\nAvailable Projects\nThere is a list of available projects under the\ntitle \u201cList of student intern projects\u201d.\nThese projects change from intake to intake,\nso please reach out if you are unsure via\nemail:  mosbergen [dot] r [at] wehi [dot] edu\n[dot] au.\nHow to Apply\nWe suggest that you write a 1 page cover\nletter introducing yourself, along with your\nresume. You can find more details under \u201cHow\nto Apply\u201d.\nThis is a popular program as we can get over\n60 applications per intake for only 30 student\nplaces. This is why it can be challenging to\naccomodate all students. We do try our best to\nprovide feedback but this is limited due to the\nnumbers involved.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 8Research\nComputing\nPlatform",

We want you to\ncome up with solutions and explain why you think it would work.\nThis is an opportunity for you to try new things in a safe environment.\n08Continuous Improvement Culture\nThis is a continuous improvement culture.\nIt is an attitude that relies on courage to highlight issues early.\nFocusing on solving the problem and getting the most from people.\nAll ideas are welcomed, all ideas need to be reviewed - judge the\nidea, not the person who came up with it.\nWork through ideas as a group.\nAsking questions when you don\u2019t know is important!\nBe careful of asking questions that have already been answered.\n09Key Continuous Improvement Skills\nTo be successful in your career, you will need to have good continuous\nimprovement skills. These are:\nTolerance for Complexity,\nTolerance for Ambiguity,\nCritical Thinking,\nLearnability,\nAdaptability,\nCollaborative by Default.\nThis internship is here to really test your continuous improvement skills in\na safe environment.10Communication is key in a\nremote workplace\nIf you haven\u2019t told me what you have done as an individual and as a\ngroup, I won\u2019t know what is happening.\nThe more you tell me, the easier it is for me to give you a good\nrecommendation in the future.\nIt is also easier for me to remember who you are and your personality if\nyou speak up in the meeting.

Details for this are on the next slide.2.\nAlso add in your profile picture under the folder Profile Pictures\n(in the WEHI-wide student intern group) and make sure the file\nname is in the format: Project Name + Name (e.g. Peter Parker\nin Student Management Project =>\n\u201cStudent_Management_Peter_Parker.png\u201d)3.\nPlease note that Open Source Contributors won\u2019t have WEHI emails. 20Code for accessing Teams group\nWe have a specific Microsoft Teams group for\nstudents, the \u201cWEHI-wide student intern group\u201d.\nPlease use this code to access this group\nthrough your Teams - once you get your WEHI\nemail address setup and log into teams.\nThe code is: mjwo2mn\nOpen source contributors will be added to this\nteam manually.21Please send a weekly email update 24 hours before\nthe meeting with:1.\nwhat each student has done, a.\nwrite down any questions you have for the\nmeeting to use as an agenda,b.\nprovide a link to the wiki, and c.\nprovide a link to the technical notes in Sharepoint d.\nRemember to ask to record the meeting to more\neasily keep notes if needed2.\nDocument the action items and make sure they are in\nthe weekly email update for next week3.Weekly meeting expectations\n22Top 5 mistakes that students make\nThe top 5 mistakes that students make:\nThey don\u2019t read the documentation 1.\nThey try to solve a problem they don\u2019t understand 2.\nThey wait to be told what to do 3.\nThey don\u2019t know how to escalate feedback 4.\nThey don\u2019t know how to share their knowledge 5.\n23Asking a confirmation question\nIt is good practice to confirm that what you are thinking matches with\nwhat your supervisor is thinking. One way to test this it to ask a\nconfirmation question.\nA confirmation question is always welcome! Here are some examples:\nJust to confirm, you want to do X because ...?\nHave I got this right - you want us to review X because ....?\nI wanted to clarify - does that mean if we do X it will ....\n24Asking your supervisor a question\nDo your proper due diligence before you send your supervisor an email\nwith a question:\nDid you search through the FAQ, check the onboarding doc, and the\nwiki onboarding page via the project pages? \nDid you ask your project teammates to help you? \nDid you write down in the email what actions you took in steps #2 and\n#3 so I know what you have tried?\nDid you specify exactly what you are having a problem with?\nDid you cc in your team mates into the email?\n25There are some ways to network\nHere are some ways to network with other RSEs (Research Software\nEngineers):\nRSE Parkville lunch on the 2nd Thursday of every month (in-person) 1.\nRSE monthly online meeting 4th Thursday of every month (online) 2.\nPrevious students in projects have caught up in-person 3.\nReach out and be proactive 4.\n26Project SummariesUnderstand Stage 1 and Stage 2\nThere is a lot of documentation so to avoid confusion:\nThe most accurate explanations are in Rowland\u2019s Students\nProject Outline\nThe 2nd most accurate explanations are the final presentations\nfrom previous students (the more recent, the more accurate)\nThe 3rd most accurate are the week 4 whiteboard\npresentations from previous students (the more recent, the\nmore accurate)\nThe 4th most accurate are the project wikis\nThere is also a FAQ, Internship handbook, and Code of Conduct.\nWork as a team, and as an intake, to cover all the documentation\nwithout duplication. 28Students Project Outline\nThis project outline provides some ideas on what\ntasks you might consider doing.\nPlease remember these are long-term goals and\nthis internship is a best effort internship. This\nmeans that I am not expecting any of these\ngoals to be completed. \nI am simply expecting that we're going to do the\nbest that we can, collaboratively.  \n29Final and Whiteboard Presentations\nThe final presentations are useful as they give\nyou an idea of what previous students did and\nwhat they found useful and challenging.\nThe whiteboard presentations are useful as they\nhelp you understand more details than the final\npresentations.\nPlease note that the whiteboard presentations\nare less likely to be recorded than the final\npresentations and you will need WEHI access.30Most projects have a public wiki\nMost projects will have a public wiki that you can\nhave a look at.\nSometimes the last students updated them,\nsometimes they need to be updated.\nOnce you have looked at the Students Project\nOutline and the final presentations, you should\nlook through the wiki of your project and your\nsister projects.\n31Ask Me Anything sessions\nIn the first week, I have sent you Ask Me Anything calendar\ninvites in the morning and afternoon.\nThis is a time to ask me anything about the process,\norganisation, and the projects.\nRemember you can:\nreview this Welcome Presentation,\nconnect with other students and sister projects via the\nnames and emails spreadsheet, and\nreview the Student Projects Outline of all the projects.32QuestionsTo participate in answering more\nquestions, please go to this QR\ncode.

Balancing what the student wants to do and benefiting WEHI is a great example of a fantastic project. The key continuous improvement skills that are tested and improved apon during this program are: Tolerance for Complexity Tolerance for Ambiguity Critical Thinking Adaptability Learnability Collaborative by Default It is important for students to understand the high-level concepts of the domain the student is working in. This increases the independence of the student to work through complexity. Students need to recognise the limited time they have and what they can achieve. This is why documentation is key to ensure information is passed to future students. The ability to learn quickly by doing your own research is important. Finding out how fast you learn and where your limits are, in a safe space, can help you to know yourself better. To get a better understanding of the internship, I provide a RCP student handbook . There are multiple internships running at the same time. We encourage students to collaborate within projects and across sister projects (similar projects) via co-working meetings.",

The process is as follows: I send an email to acknowledge their submission has been seen . If the application is not taken forward I email the  unsuccessful students as soon as possible.  If the application is taken forward I reach out to them for a short discussion. At that short discussion I explain to them the projects that might interest them and where I see that they could contribute. I explain the challenges and whether something is difficult or easy. I ask them to think about what they want. I also share with them the link to the project page so that they can see more options. This might take 15 minutes per student and takes up a lot of time, but I think it is worth it to make sure I understand them. Once they agree to a project that they want to do and that I can allocate them to, I will email them with an offer. At this point they can accept or refuse this offer.",

        "title": "During the project",
        "content": "During the project I ask students to meet a minimum of three times a week. One meeting is to meet as a team with the supervisor to understand the high-level concepts and the architectural or algorithmic limitations, another meeting is a co-working meeting with their fellow project members without the supervisor, and another meeting is a co-working meeting with \u201csister project\u201d team members to help share information across projects. I ask the students to understand the basic concepts before they choose how they would like to improve the project. So, if they want to create a web application, they can, if it contributes to solving the broader problem. In that way, we are asking them to self-direct their project to something that is interesting to them and helps build the skills they want. I have changed the way I have setup the student projects so that now students are in groups of three or more. There have been times when I have not been able to make that happen, but that is the standard as of Summer 2023/2024. You can see the key milestones and the onboarding emails we send at regular intervals during the internship . Most projects are building on the previous set of students work as they are complicated and it can take a long time for average students to grasp new domain information. These average students want to be spoon-fed, which is a major criticism that businesses have of new graduates.",

This is also a critical skill for their future careers for project handovers and maintenance work, which many students do not have experience with. As discussed earlier, the students and look at the wiki that shows what the previous students have done, and I also talk to them over the phone about the work of the previous students. This should not be a surprise to applicants that they are working on a project developed by previous interns. They can refuse the offer of the project if they find the project not to their liking. The current intake of the Genomics Metadata Multiplexing project is an example of an ongoing project that is working extremely well due to the foundational work done by previous students.

        "content": "Other Interactions I also have scheduled a voluntary follow-up session / networking session between students on Thursday across the entire student intake but have stopped these due to lack of uptake by the students. By the third week no-one attends, and I am left to myself. I also have added to the handbook and onboarding checklist the monthly in-person Research Software Engineer (RSE) lunches that I organise and attend but again, the uptake has been low. Roughly, less than 5% of students attend a lunch and none attend consistently. Last intake, I asked a group of students to liaise with another group on a project. I asked multiple times but this was not actioned. This intake, I did ask for more structure where a scheduled meeting with a sister project needed to be set and this has increased the communication between groups. In the projects where there is a need for a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I have been trialling to catchup with the SME at the 5-week mark for a Q and A. This allows the students to understand the information in the wiki and some basic terms and models of the domain so that they can make the most out of the SME\u2019s time and answers. This has been a good working model so far. I go into the office once a month, mainly for the RSE lunches. I have worked at WEHI for over 3 years now and have had an in-person meeting with my supervisor once. I am basically a remote worker. So, to increase the opportunity of in-person meetups, I have tried to get students to meet me in-person as part of the RSE lunches, but there has been little uptake. I tried to organise an in-person tour of the WEHI building last year after some questions from students, but no students responded to the email. There used to be a weekly tour of the WEHI building but this been cancelled since the pandemic. I also emailed students about an in-person student intern conference that WEHI runs every year where they could present and meet fellow student interns, but no one responded. To ensure students are aware that this is 100% remote I have updated the website and I have amended the application form to now ask them to confirm that they know that this is a 100% remote internship as appears below: I recognise that this is a 100% remote role and that all meetings and interactions will be virtual. I also recognise that there are opportunities for in-person events like the monthly Parkville Research Software Engineer lunch.",

These tags are read out via next generation sequencing and help to study important questions in biology like cancer evolution or embryonic development. Given that both the technology and the data it generates are new, no software is currently available that would facilitate the analysis, especially for experimental researchers less familiar with programming and computation. Therefore, to make this tool available to a wider community, an easy to use R package (LoxcodeR) and a graphical use-interface (GUI) to process and analyze the sequencing data generated are under development.",

        "content": "Introduction Post-sequencing quality control (QC) is an important step in ensuring that the quality of sequencing data meets expectations. Multiple tools exist to evaluate sequencing quality, such as FastQC[1], Fastq Screen[2] and Qualimap[3]. Core sequencing facilities, such as WEHI Genomics, process hundreds of sequencing runs every year. In order to troubleshoot sequencing issues and provide assurance of data quality to collaborators, sequencing facilities must implement robust data management workflows to ensure that QC data processing is automated where possible, is easily accessible and is appropriately archived for posterity. Given a large volume of runs, there exists the possibility of inter-run QC comparisons to better gauge run quality. MultiQC[4] is a software tool that collates and displays QC information from numerous supported bioinformatics tools. MultiQC operates on a per-run basis, however, MegaQC[5] collates the data from these reports for comparison. However, MegaQC has not been in active development since 2020 and is considered \u201cpretty unstable\u201d by the developers. Additionally, the software lacks functionality that lists extensive project metadata, so that experiments can be more easily tracked and MultiQC reports can be easily located. Lastly, the tool lacks easy exporting of data, so that analyses can be further analysed programmatically. Given that MegaQC overlaps with many of our use cases, it may be possible to modify and/or extend the software for our use cases. Alternatively, Shiny apps (shiny.rstudio.com) allow for interactive data analysis and provide an ideal platform for QC data collation. Integration with Monday.com and LabArchives used by the Genomics lab may also be of benefit for retrieving and/or depositing QC data and project metadata.

It plays a critical role in helping researchers by providing an extensive and comprehensive ecosystem of software tools, packages, and resources tailored specifically for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput biological data. Visualizations, especially visualizations of dimension reductions, are the workhorse of all scRNA-seq data analyses. They are hugely important during all stages of analysis, from exploring to presenting results. They often shape analysis decisions, like which batch correction approach to use, and can point to novel discoveries, like novel cell type marker genes or even new cell types. Unfortunately, currently employed visualization strategies struggle with the scale and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Overplotting is not a new problem and it has plagued many different fields, many of which have come up with unique solutions. Here, we suggest the use of hexagonal binning (Carr, 1990; Carr et al., 1987) for dimension reduction representations of scRNA-seq data. In order to make hexagonal plotting readily available to the scientific community, we developed schex (single-cell hexagonal plotting), an R package that allows users to produce hexagonal binning representations for dimension reductions of scRNA-seq. However, maintaining research software and making it easy to use can be difficult for researchers in the long run. This project is to aim at finding out which areas of software maintenance can possibly abstracted away from the researcher and into the hands of a Research Software Engineer (RSE).",

Data integration enables identification of specific biological relationships between these features (e.g. genes and proteins), to create new insights into molecular processes involved in health and disease. MixOmics includes 19 data integration methods, amongst which 13 were developed in our lab. These methods are all based on dimension reduction using Projection to Latent Structures (PLS). Our users include computational biologists, molecular biologists and bioinformaticians who wish to integrate their data and identify signatures of genes, proteins etc. to explain or predict a disease outcome. The package (ranked in the top 5% package in Bioconductor) is easy to use because all methods use the same underlying PLS principles and produce numerous graphics for interpretation (Fig. 1).

This is because it would require a good mastery of the methods and would only apply towards the end of the internship. After the (steep) learning phase, there will be opportunities for students to propose new features and functionalities in the package if they wish. Figure 1.

This is a type of metadata. While this allows the sequencing facility to save money by processing samples in bulk, the ability to keep track of these multiplexes is complicated. This is especially significant because there is no resourcing to provide an assistant to be able to check the quality all the metadata at the time of multiplexing.

        "title": "Introduction",
        "content": "Introduction Our cells contain a vast array of interacting organelles (tiny structures within cells that perform specific tasks, similar to the parts of a machine) that determine cellular processes through both health and disease. These structures may be imaged using electron microscopy by bouncing electrons off heavy-metal stained membranes. The resulting images have a resolution of nanometers per voxel (the 3D equivalent of an image pixel) in 3D and each data set may contain millions or billions of voxels per cell. [1] In a paper from 2021 [2] a new method for processing images from the focused ion beam-scanning EM (FIB-SEM) was used to image the cellular ultrastructure of phagophore-ER contacts in three dimensions. As per the paper: FIB-SEM is ideally suited for the acquisition of 3D ultrastructural images from large cellular volumes (Hoffman et al., 2020). However, traditional methods for the reconstruction and analysis of such data require manual image segmentation and classification. The hand-drawn surfaces that are generated during manual segmentation are laborious to produce, low throughput, and subject to human imprecision, making them unsuitable for large-scale morphometric analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed an approach that delegates the most time-consuming tasks to an artificial intelligence (AI) within a framework that captures the true surface detail of intracellular organelles. Using the machine learning capabilities of Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) in combination with ImageJ (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2004; Schindelin et al., 2012), we trained a random forest computer vision model to faithfully detect all cellular membranes in volumetric FIB-SEM data (Figures 6A and 6B). We have termed this 3D framework AIVE (AI-directed voxel extraction; workflow outlined in Figure S7). The project would involve a series of stages to bring the software infrastructure to a level that will help with development. The initial stage would involve the setup of the workflow along with testing and improving the documentation of the workflow on a local laptop. The potential second stage would be to aim to run the workflow in the WEHI HPC environment known as Milton. The potential third stage would be to add more data to test the workflow to ensure that the test coverage is broader than it is currently. Once this third stage is achieved, there will be an opportunity to work on streamlining the AIVE workflow.

As an example, standard Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) calling in cancer involves alignment of the sequencing reads to a reference genome, sorting and indexing, variant calling, and subsequent annotation against various databases. Each of these stages comprises of one or more software tools with different input requirements. As a result, reproducibility is difficult to achieve due to the large number of components and the complicated dependency structure inherent in both building the software tools and execution of the workflow. A recently proposed solution to the problem, BioNix[1], leverages the Nix[2] functional package management system to both manage the software and execute the workflow. This has allowed an unprecedented level of reproducibility in the field. In this project, we expose you to Open Source and ask you to become an open source contributor to global open source Nix packages.",

For others you can use the following options: If you want to use a High Performance Computer (HPC) to learn more skills, or you have bigger requirements of storage and compute than can fit on your laptop, you can use the Milton HPC To get access to Milton HPC, all WEHI researchers must first submit a request. If you use Milton HPC, you can use the VAST scratch space for your temporary storage . If you want to run a web server or service, then you can use Nectar, the Australian Research Cloud using your WEHI email and password. If you have small data files that your supervisor says is OK to share publicly and you want to share with future students, you can use figshare . If you have small data files that your supervisor says is not OK to share publicly and you want to share with future students, you can use the WEHI-wide student intern group on Sharepoint/Teams. . If you have big data files and you want to share with future students, you can talk to your supervisor about using VAST projects . It would be rare for students to need a VAST project space, so please ask your supervisor first. Research Computing Platform (RCP) also has training courses available for things like Python, Git, Linux, Milton and more . RCP also has a drop-in session that you can go to ask technical questions about high-performance computing (HPC), Slurm usage, cloud computing, general programming, R, Python, package development, code optimisation, data processing, data storage, and data management.",

Make sure you use \u201cAny Availability Zone\u201d if you are using Nectar as some of the University of Melbourne hosts are full. It is recommended to use NeCTAR Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy) amd64 so that students can share documentation between projects and intakes. Make sure you enable 22 SSH access with 0.0.0.0/0 using CIRS. See the Nectar SSH troubleshooting guide . If you want to run a web server, it is recommended to use SSL and therefore you will need to enable 443 HTTPS access with 0.0.0.0/0 using CIRS. See the Nectar SSH troubleshooting guide . If you want to run a flask development server, it is recommended to use SSL and therefore you will need to enable port 5000 access with 0.0.0.0/0 using CIRS. For other non-standard ports you will have to do a similar setup. See the Nectar SSH troubleshooting guide . We should also have a standard to setup a SSL web certificate in the future.",

The early draft is to make sure you are on the right track, and the late draft is to polish things. Please put them into Teams Files / Sharepoint so that they can be commented on directly by your supervisors. We create a single document for all summary reports to be filed together. You will be sent a link to this document when it is ready. The one page project summary audience is for myself and potential researchers who want to understand what you have done from a high level point of view, but can easily click on links to get to the technical detail / reports / visualisations. The one page summary should be handed in before the presentation or before the internship finishes. For your final presentation \u2013 please make sure you have an acknowledgement slide and show the slides to your supervisor before your final presentation. A good example of a set of slides is here. And here is another final student presentation example, although it is a little long. .
